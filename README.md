## Required Software: ##
* MATLAB
* SOSTOOLS (https://www.cds.caltech.edu/sostools/)
* SDPT3 (http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/sdpt3.html)

Note: These case studes were constructed using MATLAB 2018. Additionally, the symbolic toolbox is required. It is possible to execute the code without the symbolic toolbox (see SOSTOOLs manual for details).
