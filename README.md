## Required Software: ##
* MATLAB
* SOSTOOLS (https://www.cds.caltech.edu/sostools/)
* SDPT3 (http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/sdpt3.html)

Note: These case studes were constructed using MATLAB 2018. Additionally, the symbolic toolbox is required. It is possible to execute the code without the symbolic toolbox (see SOSTOOLs manual for details).

## Case Study 1: ##
casestudy1_main.m:  <br />
* Running this file will run the algorith which was used to produce the results of this paper. The required toolboxes are mentioned above. You may run the individual dependencies separately to get a more careful look at the corresponding results. This case study is for the 1-D stochastic dynamics. 

## Case Study 2: ##
casestudy2_main.m:  <br />
* Running this file will run the algorith which was used to produce the results of this paper. The required toolboxes are mentioned above. You may run the individual dependencies separately to get a more careful look at the corresponding results. These results are for the 2-D stochastic dynamics.
